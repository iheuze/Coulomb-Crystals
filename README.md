# Coulomb-Crystals
The final write up and sample code code from my final year thesis
"Coulomb Crystals: Investigation into the Equilibrium States of Ions Confined to Two Dimensions"
The positions of ions in equilibrium were identified and the resulting structures were 
analysed using energy measurements and techniques
such as Average Nearest Neighbour distances, Voronoi Entropy, and Radial Distribution Functions
